## Project Title: T20 World Cup – Best Playing XI Analysis

### Project Overview

This project focuses on selecting the **Best Playing XI in T20 cricket** using a **data-driven approach**, without relying on opponent-specific strengths or weaknesses.
The core objective is to build a **balanced team** that can:

* Score **at least 180 runs on average**
* Defend **150 runs on average**

To achieve this, detailed **performance-based parameters** were defined for each player role, and interactive dashboards were created to support selection decisions .

## Problem Statement

Traditional team selection often depends on subjective opinions. This project aims to:

* Use **historical T20 performance data**
* Define **clear, measurable criteria**
* Select players purely based on **data and consistency**

---

##  Player Role Classification & Parameters

Players were categorized into the following roles, each with **well-defined KPIs**:

###  Openers

* Batting Average > 30
* Strike Rate > 140
* Boundary % > 50
* Innings Batted > 3
* Batting Position < 4

###  Anchors / Middle Order

* Batting Average > 40
* Strike Rate > 125
* Avg. Balls Faced > 20
* Innings Batted > 3
* Batting Position > 2

###  Finishers / Lower Order Anchors

* Batting Average > 25
* Strike Rate > 130
* Avg. Balls Faced > 12
* Innings Bowled > 1
* Batting Position > 4

###  All-Rounders / Lower Order

* Batting Average > 15
* Strike Rate > 140
* Bowling Economy < 7
* Bowling Strike Rate < 20
* Innings Bowled > 2

###  Specialist Fast Bowlers

* Bowling Economy < 7
* Bowling Strike Rate < 16
* Bowling Average < 20
* Dot Ball % > 40
* Bowling Style = Fast

(All parameters are defined based on **performance consistency and match impact**) .

##  Key Outcomes

* Objective selection of **Best Playing XI**
* Clear justification for each player’s role
* Improved decision-making using **data instead of intuition**
* Visually appealing and stakeholder-ready dashboard

---

##  Learnings

* Importance of **parameter scoping** before analysis
* Translating sports performance into **business-style KPIs**
* End-to-end analytics workflow:
  **Excel → Python → Power BI**
* Dashboard design and storytelling best practices


##  Conclusion

This project demonstrates how **analytics can be applied beyond business use cases**, such as sports, to drive **objective, high-impact decisions**. 
It highlights strong skills in **data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving** using real-world constraints.
